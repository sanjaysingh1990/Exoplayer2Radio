How to contribute to Transistor
===============================

### Report a bug or suggest a new feature
Bugs and new features are being discussed on the GitHub [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/y20k/transistor/issues). The issue "[Previous discussions and feature requests](https://github.com/y20k/transistor/issues/48)" lists some of the features that were rejected - either because they did not fit conceptually or because I could not figure out how to implement them.

### Help with translations
The translations are managed on [Weblate](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/transistor/strings/). 

### Submit your own solutions
Help is very welcome. Be it in the form of code, or artwork, or enhancements to the website, or tutorial videos, or whatever. 
**But please** suggest new features or enhancements in advance on the [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/y20k/transistor/issues) before implementing them.

### Credt for your contributions
Contributors - like the main translators for a certain language - are listed as co-autors of this project in [AUTHORS.md](https://github.com/y20k/transistor/blob/master/AUTHORS.md). Bonus: If you are on this list, you are automatically eligable for a free German beverage.
